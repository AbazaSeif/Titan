Cryptocurrency trading bot framework

Objective: Write a cryptocurrency trading bot in a framework that allows for the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to determine trade behavior.
 
Project structure: Community driven based on a public GitHub repo alongside private algorithm repos. Everyone in the discord currently is a permanent member of the project. Additional invitations can be made if the need arises.
 
Languages used: The consensus is this bot will be written primarily in Python 3 since team members are all familiar with the language and it has easy API integration. Other languages are also possible in certain contexts.
 
Exchange details: The consensus is Bittrex due to an easily available API and relaxed registration requirements.
 
Currency pairs: This still needs to be determined but BTC/USD is a good starting point. From there other trading pairs can certainly be introduced.
 
Indicators: Mostly price and volume indicators. Trailing indicators seem to have limited value in crypto due to the extreme volatility.
 
Machine learning algorithms: The bot framework should be able to incorporate deep learning via algorithms such as neural networks, sentiment analysis via NLP, and other data driven systems.
