A beginner friendly cryptocurrency automated trading framework.

Titan is a totally free automated cryptocurrency trading system for traders of all skill levels. Built on top of the ccxt API library, it works out of the box with any exchange and trading pair. We believe in decentralizing trading strategies and providing everyone access to building advanced crypto portfolios. The future of algorithmic trading is here!

The base framework comes with a set of methods that allow you to program trading logic and write data to your own database with ease. A sample strategy based on moving average crossovers is provided out of the box to experiment as well as a full simulation suite where one can trade fake BTC against real market prices. The original objective of the project was to write a cryptocurrency trading bot in a framework that allows for the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to determine trade behavior.

## FAQ

#### Spare me the mumbo-jumbo! What's this all about?
IT PRINTS MONEY

#### But wait, why would you ever release this for free??? hurr-durr profits
Ah yes, I see you've taken a basic microeconomics course before. Truth is, this is mainly a project to encourage people to write their own strategies and have a way to test them out. We want to lower the bar to algorithmic cryptocurrency trading to those who are interested but don't know where to start.
